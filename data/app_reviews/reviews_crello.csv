Bad,1,"Have you guys ever try crello on desktop? The page always go blank when you click on next page to edit. Then you need to refresh again, happened again, refresh again and again and again. Not recommended🙂",ssnkh,1.10.0,2021-01-20,1402471998,Crello,Malaysia
Still needs work,1,"It can be considered an alternative to Canva, but it’s too limited. Almost every icon and illustration requires you to purchase the premium product. Like out of 15 templates, only 1 is free. I tried using one of the templates, everything looks fine until I saved it. There’s no option like Canva to save as PDF or JPEG, and the saved image is different from what I see in the app where the elements and icons are all over the place.",purrncess,1.5.5,2020-03-04,1402471998,Crello,Malaysia
